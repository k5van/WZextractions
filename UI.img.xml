			<string name="0" value="This class mainly uses swords and axes, and possesses significant attack power. While attacking, you&apos;ll gain combo orbs, which can inflict great damage once fully charged."/>
			<string name="1" value="Activate Combo Attack for a chance to gaining combo orbs while attacking. Your Attack Power and Final Damage increase for each combo orb. When the combo orbs are fully charged, you can use Enhanced Raging Blow. Scarring Sword leaves an indelible piercing wound on the enemy, and increases damage when the pierced enemy is attacked. Flash Blade increases mobility by allowing you to charge forward and slash at the targeted enemy. You can even attack from a distance with Beam Blade, aiming and firing energy from your sword."/>

		<imgdir name="122">
			<string name="0" value="This class utilizes Holy Power skills to increase its Attack Power and reduce damage taken. It can also conjure a hammer from pure light."/>
			<string name="1" value="Utilize Holy Power skills continuously to accumulate Light Charges. As your number of Light Charges increase, your Attack Power and HP Recovery increase, and your damage taken is reduced. Light Charges also empower Divine Charge and Blast to attack additional enemies. Skills like Combat Orders and Noble Demand, which empower your party members, Sacrosanctity, which grants temporary invincibility, and Divine Shield, which reduces the damage you take, can all help you go the distance in battle."/>

		<imgdir name="132">
			<string name="0" value="This class specializes in spears and polearms, weapons with a long reach. It also summons the Evil Eye, a messenger of darkness, which can be used in various ways in battle. The contract with darkness allows a Dark Knight to ignore death, even after reaching 0 HP, and punish enemies for their insolence."/>
			<string name="1" value="Evil Eye can be used in various ways in battle. Cross Surge grows stronger based on your current HP. Dark Thirst recovers HP when the enemy is attacked, making you extremely difficult to kill. Gungnir&apos;s Descent hurls a mythical spear, inflicting damage on a handful of enemies. The contract with darkness allows you to ignore death with Final Pact, even after reaching 0 HP, and the Accept Final Pact skill allows you to be flexible with the contract&apos;s terms."/>

		<imgdir name="212">
			<string name="0" value="This class specializes in Fire and Poison magic. Most attack skills inflict damage over time (DoT), and the attacks become stronger the more damage over time is inflicted. "/>
			<string name="1" value="Fire and Poison magic both inflict damage on enemies over time. Every time the enemy receives damage over time, regardless of the element, all attacks become stronger with Fervent Drain. Poison skills, such as Creeping Toxin and Poison Mist, gain control of the surroundings, and can cause explosions when combined with various Fire skills or Mist Eruption. Megiddo Flame is a Fire spell that can burn even the soul. Flames spread to damage even more enemies every time you attack."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="222">
			<string name="0" value="This class specializes in lightning and ice magic. Ice attacks have a Freezing effect. Attacking with a powerful lightning magic, on an enemy that has Freezing effect stacks, will inflict even more damage. "/>
			<string name="1" value="Use Ice magic to Freeze the enemies. Hitting frozen enemies with Lightning magic inflicts more damage through Freezing Crush. The high-voltage Chain Lightning spreads through nearby enemies for a chain attack. You can instantly freeze enemies with Freezing Breath to prevent them from moving, as well as summon a Lightning Orb that inflicts great damage over time."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="232">
			<string name="0" value="This class has beneficial skills that heal and support allies, such as the Angel of Benevolence. Conversely, the Angel of Benevolence can turn into the Avenging Angel, with skills specialized for attack."/>
			<string name="1" value="This class has a variety of buff skills to support allies. Its holy power skills, such as Holy Fountain and Holy Water, restore HP even when party members aren&apos;t nearby. Dispel can remove abnormal status effects, and Resurrection can even revive dead party members. However, when you use Righteously Indignant to change the Angel of Benevolence to the Avenging Angel, the supportive Benevolence skills will instead become powerful Revenge skills. With that in mind, this class can be flexible."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="312">
			<string name="0" value="This class specializes in using bows for long-ranged attacks. It also carries special arrowheads, which can be swapped out according to the situation. With its rapid-fire archery, which often leaves an afterimage, this class keeps enemies pinned down nonstop."/>
			<string name="1" value="Possessing quick attack skills and mobility, this class facilitates fast-paced, technique-driven combat. It can fire nonstop arrows with Arrow Blaster, which can be used directly or placed in a location of your choice. Speed Mirage fires arrows fast enough to leave an afterimage. Each time you fire a certain number of shots, the afterimage pursues nearby enemies. Quiver Cartridge is a special arrowhead which lets you choose either a Magic Arrow or Blood Arrow. You can receive the effects of the special arrowhead every time you attack."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="322">
			<string name="0" value="This class specializes in using crossbows for long-ranged attacks. Each time you fire a certain number of shots, the next shot fills with powerful energy."/>
			<string name="1" value="This class&apos;s crossbow is slower than a bow, but more powerful. Piercing Arrow fires an arrow that can skewer enemies even at long range. Snipe aims for the enemy&apos;s vital points, and can deal a fatal attack from a distance. When Piercing Arrow or Snipe hit a certain number of times, an Empowered technique kicks in, allowing you to use a powerful Empowered Piercing Arrow or Empowered Snipe in the next attack."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="332">
			<string name="0" value="An adventurer captivated by the allure of ancient artifacts, who fell under a powerful curse while exploring ruins deep in the forest and began to channel the curse&apos;s tainted energy. Uses the Ancient Bow by linking three archery skills to charge up the power of a relic, then expending the relic&apos;s built-up energy to loose powerful bolts of black, hex-touched energy."/>
			<string name="1" value="Relic Charge fills up the Relic Gauge every time you attack the enemy with Cardinal Force skills. Consume the Relic Gauge to use powerful Ancient Force skills, such as Glyph of Impalement and Enchant Force skills, whose effects are determined by the currently-displayed emblem (such as Combo Assault). Also, Bountiful skills and Relic Charge II give you a powerful effect every time the emblem is changed with Cardinal Force skills. Curseweaver inflicts the Ancient Curse debuff on the enemy, dealing as much damage as the stacked curse."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="412">
			<string name="0" value="This class specializes in showering enemies with throwing stars from long range. More than that, many of the stars are imbued with magical talismans, which can attack enemies over a wide area."/>
			<string name="1" value="The Quad Star skill allows fast and powerful throwing star attacks. Shadow Surge allows you to become one with the shadows and move in technique-driven combat. Assassin&apos;s Mark grants a chance to leave a mark on your target; the next attack on a marked enemy will cause several throwing stars to emerge, dealing additional damage to other enemies nearby. Showdown attacks multiple enemies with a shadow-powered shuriken."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="422">
			<string name="0" value="This class wields daggers, hiding behind a smokescreen or in the shadows before assassinating enemies with deadly consecutive attacks. Uses various skills in conjunction with Mesos, representing luck."/>
			<string name="1" value="You can attack enemies in a wide area with Pick Pocket, which steals their Mesos and leaves them on the ground, as well as Meso Explosion, which flings those Mesos back at them. Activating Blood Money, which drops Mesos with the assassin&apos;s mark, allows you to gain the assassin&apos;s Murderous Intent buff when enemies are hit with Meso Explosion. Using Assassinate while you have the Murderous Intent buff allows you to deal a more powerful final blow. Smokescreen and Shadow Veil maintain Dark Sight, allowing you to avoid attacks and attack the enemy at the same time."/>

		<imgdir name="434">
			<string name="0" value="This class is a member of the Secret Garden, a secretive organization, which uses a pair of bladed weapons for flurries of devastating attacks."/>
			<string name="1" value="With its varied movement skills, this class has excellent mobility. It can also use Blade Fury and Phantom Blow, techniques of the Secret Garden, to deal consecutive attacks. Its Mirror Image technique creates a double of the user, inflicting greater damage. Mirrored Target, which separates out the user&apos;s shadow, helps the class survive enemy attacks, as do Final Cut and Chains of Hell, which grant temporary invincibility. Asura&apos;s Anger creates a vortex of wind blades, annihilating enemies."/>
		</imgdir>
		<imgdir name="512">
			<string name="0" value="This class uses knuckle-based fighting techniques to suppress enemies. With the power of the Sea Serpent, which materializes automatically when using fighting skills, it can deal additional attacks."/>
			<string name="1" value="This class hones its body into a living weapon, specializing in weakening enemies. Its affinity with the sea allows it to call the fearsome Sea Serpent for help in battle. The Sea Serpent skill periodically activates when using fighting skills. Activating the Serpent Scale, which gathers the traces that form every time the Sea Serpent materializes, allows use of the Assault skill, which is a more powerful Sea Serpent skill. "/>

		<imgdir name="522">
			<string name="0" value="This class fires barrages of bullets. It can also summon the brave crewmen and weapons of the Nautilus for various types of attacks."/>
			<string name="1" value="Rapid Fire showers the enemy with bullets. Brain Scrambler inflicts fatal damage with a single hit. Scurvy Summons calls the crew of the Nautilus into battle. Broadside and Siege Bomber call in the Nautilus&apos; artillery, marking the target with Firing Orders. Whaler&apos;s Potion strengthens your already-mighty body with the captain&apos;s spirit and enhances all summons."/>

		<imgdir name="532">
			<string name="0" value="This class wields Hand Cannons to launch powerful long-range attacks. It also comes complete with a monkey, who assists with heavy bombing attacks."/>
			<string name="1" value="Cannon Bazooka specializes in long-ranged attacks, releasing a blast of tightly packed gunpowder. Cannon Barrage focuses on a single enemy to deal an explosive attack. Buckshot reduces damage but increases Attack Speed, for a triple amplification to the number of all attacks, by applying special buckshot to the Cannoneer&apos;s ammunition. The Cannoneer&apos;s reliable partner, the monkey, provides support in battle by throwing Monkey Mortars at the enemy. Rolling Rainbow summons three cannons that mercilessly blast enemies."/>
